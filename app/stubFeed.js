But is that really why the milk is in the back? Can you really have a business model intentionally built around inconveniencing your customers? Today on the show, two big theories to answer this little question: Why is the milk in the back of the store? The theories reflect very different world views.

It sets up experiments in hospitals all over the country to try to figure out how to save money without lowering the quality of care. On today's show, we visit a hospital in Akron, Ohio that's engaged in one of these experiments. We sit in on a tense conversation where doctors argue about why it's so hard to start surgery on time. And we hear what happens when you change the way hospitals and doctors get paid.","enclosure":{"filesize":0,"type":"audio/mpeg","url":"https://play.podtrac.com/npr-510289/npr.mc.tritondigital.com/NPR_510289/media/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/510289/255454398/npr_255454398.mp3?orgId=1&p=510289&story=255454398&t=podcast&e=255454398&ft=pod&f=510289"}},{"title":"#503: Adding Up The Cost Of The Planet Money T-Shirt","published":"2013-12-14T03:33:41.000Z","guid":"http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/510289/250881548/npr_250881548.mp3","description":"Today's show is the final installment of the Planet Money T-shirt project.

But a lot of the clothes get sold, packed in bales and sent across the ocean in a container ship. The U.S. exports over a billion pounds of used clothing every year â€” and much of that winds up in used clothing markets in sub-Saharan Africa. On today's show, we visit a giant used-clothing market in Nairobi, Kenya to see what happens to American clothes (including, presumably, some Planet Money T-shirts) after Americans are done with them.","duration":1205,"enclosure":{"filesize":9707189,"type":"audio/mpeg","url":"https://play.podtrac.com/npr-510289/npr.mc.tritondigital.com/NPR_510289/media/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/510289/250254701/npr_250254701.mp3?orgId=1&d=1205&p=510289&story=250254701&t=podcast&e=250254701&ft=pod&f=510289"}},{"title":"#501: A Shirt, A Meat Grinder And The Book Of Everything","published":"2013-12-07T04:23:32.000Z","guid":"http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/510289/249394688/npr_249394688.mp3","description":"On today's show, the Planet Money T-shirts arrive at the Port of Miami.

Squadrons of government agents use tools of violence and destruction to ensure that the rules laid out in the book are followed.

The innovation is a box. A big, metal box. The standard shipping container has completely transformed commerce in the past 50 years. It's part of the reason the Planet Money men's T-shirt comes from cotton grown in Mississippi, spun into yarn in Indonesia, and sewn together in Bangladesh. On today's show, we see the shipping container in action, and hear the story behind it.
